    "## Part 1 - Payment Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "We now graduate to doing something really serious... I mean, really really serious things that are relevant to our business - bond valuation. By the end of this week, you will know how to price a vanilla treasury bond and be able to challenge the QARM team's calculation if they ever get it wrong! ^_^\n",
    "\n",
    "When valuating fixed income instruments, we must first identify future cash flows.  Today's challenge is to build a payment schedule for a bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Julia package called `BondPricing` (or Python module) for this marathon\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a struct (or class in Python) with\n",
    "  - cusip\n",
    "  - coupon (e.g. 0.03 means 3%)\n",
    "  - maturity date\n",
    "  - coupon frequency (e.g. 2 means semi-annual)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a function `payment_schedule(bond, as_of_date)` that returns a DataFrame with the following columns:\n",
    "  - `date`: date of the cash flow\n",
    "  - `amount`: coupon payment, or coupon+principal for the last payment\n",
    "  - `days`: number of days between as of date and payment date\n",
    "  \n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Your code must be able to handle coupon frequency of 1, 2, 4, and 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- You can assume par amount of \\\\$1,000 (e.g. you get \\\\$20 for every period for a 4% semi-annual coupon bond)\n",
    "- Typically, a semi-annual coupon bond will pay coupon every 6 months on the same day of month.  For example, a bond maturing on 15-Aug-2028 will make coupon payments on 15-Feb and 15-Aug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your solution by running the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "bond = Bond(\"TESTBOND2\", 0.04, Date(2028, 8, 15), 2)\n",
    "as_of_date = Date(2018, 8, 15)\n",
    "@show payment_schedule(bond, as_of_date)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reuslt should look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "│ Row │ date       │ amount  │ days  │\n",

    "\n",
    "Just FYI:\n",
    "1. In many cases, we are not so certain about future cash flows. For example, for a mortgage-backed security, the borrower may prepay the loan and we end up receiving more cash than expected. Likewise, a corporate bond may be called before maturity date. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In practice, if the payment date falls on a weekend or holiday then it needs to be adjusted to the following buisness date but for this exercise we can ignore that."

    "## Part 2 - Pricing Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond is valued as how investors perceives to obtain a certain yield.  Hence, the price of a bond is simply the net present value of all future cash flows discounted back to today based on an internal rate of return called _yield to maturity_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bond that pays annual coupon:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "$C$ = coupon, \n",
    "$P$ = principal,\n",
    "$r$ = yield to maturity,\n",
    "$n$ = number of periods\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate $PV$ for a bond with semi-annual coupon (coupon frequency = 2), several adjustments must be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $C$ is divided by 2 \n",
    "* $r$ is divided by 2\n",
    "* $n$ is multiplied by 2 (so we have twice the number of terms than an annual coupon bond)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\frac{1}{(1 + r)^t}$ term in the above formula is called _discount factor_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enhance the function `payment_schedule(bond::Bond, as_of_date::Date, yield::Float64)` to accept yield as a new argument.  Now, it must return the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `date`: date of the cash flow\n",
    "  - `amount`: coupon payment, or coupon+principal for the last payment\n",
    "  - `days`: number of days between the as of date and the payment date\n",
    "  - (new) `discount_factor`: discount factor for the period\n",
    "  - (new) `value`: present value of the cash flow, which is simply amount multipled by discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a new function `price(bond::Bond, as_of_date::Date, yield::Float64)` that returns the price of the bond, as calculated below. You can assume par amount of \\\\$1,000 and round the result to 8 decimal places.\n",
